 
   C program is a bulding blocks of functions.
   if a C program containes atleast one function means, then it must
   be main();

   Every C program execution starts from main().
 
    function: 
    ---------  It is a sub program in a main program to perform,
    a specific task.	

    Advantages:
    -----------
    i) Easy to write, Easy to understand, Easy to Debug the code.
    ii) Reusability
    iii)Efficient memory utilization
    iv) Reduced Source Code.

	When a function is called then there is a memory allocation is done in a stack and that is called push operation, Once if the function task is over, then it will de-allocates the memory is called pop operation.

	For every C programming execution, 8MB memory is allocated in a stack.

	function instructions are executing from code section, and functions local variables and function return addresses memory is allocated in a stack section. 

 Any program execution starts with main() and ends with main().

	syntax for function :
	--------------------
	return-type function_name(arguments);

    To design any function, there are 3 aspects.

    1) function declaration : it is an intimation to a compiler that what type of 
       ------------------------------ function it is before we use it.

    2) function call : To call a function. 
       -------------------	

    3) function definition : it is an actual function implementation
         -------------------------   to perform a specific task.

   Pre-defined functions		  User-defined functions	
	 
    (library functions)       (user implemented functions in program)

   
    function-aspect      pre-defined fun     User-defined fun
    ---------------------      --------------------     -----------------------
    fun declaration       header file            program

    fun call                   program               program

    fun definition          library                  program


    A function can be in 4types (pre-define or user-defined)
    ---------------------------
    i) A function has no return value and no arguments.	
       Ex : a) void fun(void);

   ii) A function has return value and no arguments.
       Ex : a) int fun(void);
	    b) char fun(void);
	
  iii) A function has no return value and has arguemnts.
       Ex : a)void fun(int,char);
	    b)void fun(char,float);
	    c)void fun(double);
	
   iv) A function has return value and arguments.
	Ex : a) int fun(int);
	     b) char fun(char);
	     c) float fun(float,double); 

	
   Actual arguments : Arguments that are present in the function call.
   formal arguments : Arguments that are present in the function definition.
